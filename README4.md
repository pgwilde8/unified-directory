I'll review all three README files for you. Let me read them to understand the project structure and documentation.

I've reviewed all three README files. Here's a comprehensive analysis of your Business Directory project:

## üìã Project Overview

You have a **dual-architecture business directory platform** with two distinct systems:

### 1. **Legacy System** (README.md)
- **Port**: 9178
- **Database**: `directory` (adminwatch/adminwatch123)
- **Purpose**: Original single-tenant business directory
- **Features**: Google OAuth, business listings, admin dashboard
- **Status**: Production-ready with systemd service

### 2. **Multi-tenant Platform** (README2.md)
- **Port**: 9179  
- **Database**: `directory_tenant` (adminwatch/adminwatch123)
- **Purpose**: White-label, multi-tenant SaaS platform
- **Features**: Custom domains, Stripe billing, S3 storage, PostGIS
- **Status**: Development/API-only (no systemd service)

### 3. **System Management** (README3.md)
- **Purpose**: Quick reference for service management
- **Focus**: Commands for both systems

## üîç Key Observations

### **Database Configuration Mismatch**
There's a discrepancy in the database credentials:
- **README.md** shows: `adminwatch` user for both databases
- **README2.md** shows: `dir-admin` user for multi-tenant database
- **Your .env file** shows: `dir-admin` user for `directories` database

### **Service Management**
- Legacy system has proper systemd service (`directory`)
- Multi-tenant system runs manually (no systemd service)
- Both systems can run simultaneously on different ports

### **Architecture Evolution**
The project has evolved from a single-tenant system to a sophisticated multi-tenant SaaS platform with:
- Row-level security
- Custom domain support
- Stripe billing integration
- DigitalOcean Spaces storage
- PostGIS geographic features

## üö® Recommendations

1. **Standardize Database Credentials**: Clarify which database user should be used for the multi-tenant system
2. **Create Systemd Service**: Set up a proper systemd service for the multi-tenant platform
3. **Update Documentation**: Sync the database credentials across all README files
4. **Environment Files**: The multi-tenant system references `env.tenant` but your current `.env` is for the legacy system

Would you like me to help you:
- Create a systemd service for the multi-tenant platform?
- Standardize the database configuration?
- Update the documentation to be consistent?
- Set up the multi-tenant system properly?

I see there's a README4.md file that might have more recent information. Let me read that first to understand what Camilo has been working on, and then help you fix the multi-tenant setup.

I see that README4.md contains the analysis I just provided. Let me check the current state of your system to understand what Camilo has been working on and help you fix the multi-tenant setup.

Now let me check the current state of your system and see what's actually running on port 9178:

Now I understand the issue! Let me check what's currently running and help you fix this. Based on what I can see:

1. **Camilo has been working on the multi-tenant system** (`main_tenant.py`) which is designed to run on port 9179
2. **Your current systemd service** (`directory.service`) is running the **legacy system** (`backend.main:app`) on port 9178
3. **The multi-tenant system is not running** because it doesn't have a systemd service

Let me create a todo list to fix this properly:

Perfect! Now I can see the issue clearly. Let me update the todo and fix this:

## üîç Current Situation Analysis

**What's happening:**
- ‚úÖ **Legacy system is running** on port 9178 (via systemd service)
- ‚ùå **Multi-tenant system is NOT running** on port 9179
- üîß **Camilo has been working on the multi-tenant system** but it's not set up as a service

**The Problem:**
Your systemd service is running the **legacy system** (`backend.main:app`) instead of the **multi-tenant system** (`backend.main_tenant:app`). Camilo has been developing the multi-tenant system, but it's not running because there's no systemd service for it.

## ÔøΩÔøΩÔ∏è Solution Options

You have two options to fix this:

### **Option 1: Replace Legacy with Multi-tenant (Recommended)**
- Stop the legacy service
- Update the systemd service to run the multi-tenant system
- This gives you the full multi-tenant platform on port 9178

### **Option 2: Run Both Systems**
- Keep legacy on port 9178
- Create a new systemd service for multi-tenant on port 9179
- Run both systems simultaneously

**Which option would you prefer?** Based on your question about "fixing" the multi-tenant work, I recommend **Option 1** - replacing the legacy system with the multi-tenant system that Camilo has been working on.

Let me know which approach you'd like, and I'll help you implement it! [[memory:8654444]]
